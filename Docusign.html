      <h3>What are digital signatures</h3>
      <p>What is the definition of an electronic signature?
        Electronic signatures allow you to legally sign digital documents and replace handwritten "wet" signatures on paper.
        </p>
      <p>DocuSign's software enables parties to electronically sign contracts and other documents rather than signing them with pen and paper. This eliminates the necessity for contract parties to be physically present at the same location. Important security protocols are also provided by the technology. Documents that have been signed are uploaded and encrypted with a unique hash. The hash can then be compared to a document to guarantee that 
        the contract or other uploaded document has not been tampered with.</p>
        <p>The commercial 
          growth rate of e-signature usage is high, 
          indicating that firms swiftly adopted the technology. 
          Many of our readers, in fact, already use e-signature technology.
           Furthermore, research indicates that the use of electronic signatures
            (e-signatures) will continue to expand. Researchers recently estimated that the worldwide e-signature market will continue to grow at a double-digit annual growth rate through 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 34.7%.</p>
            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>What are the primary benefits of electronically processing and signing contracts?
              Electronic contract execution provides numerous advantages to all parties:
              It saves you time: Contracts can be signed swiftly and easily from any internet-enabled device, anywhere, at any time.
              It lowers process costs: Paper contracts do not need to be mailed and then scanned.
              It guarantees security and enforceability: The platform satisfies all eIDAS regulations as well as US and European recognized standards for contract protection, encryption, and security.
              It improves transparency: Because all parties can easily check the status of a contract, missing documents or data are no longer an issue.</p>
