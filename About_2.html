As enterprises look to move more workloads off-premises, they need strategies to mitigate risk and ensure that their service providers can work with any remaining on-premises environments, other key external service providers, while complying with governance and compliance requirements that are also changing.

It would be impractical to think of conducting business without digital technologies. They form the backbone of the digital enterprise and also are key to aligning the business with IT for efficiency and agility.

Solely placing emphasis on digital infrastructures and the alignment of business with IT are, however, insufficient for the future of the truly collaborative digital enterprise. There is much more at stake in the digital evolution. The digital enterprise needs to also address the additional convergence of applications, data and the capacities to execute, store and connect, truly the convergence of a portfolio of services and choices that offer an optimized combination of policy, placement and capabilities.

Senior management increasingly view technology as a competitive advantage. Today's digital enterprise can be better prepared and enabled as a scalable, integrated, and optimized organization for efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness.

Challenging this is the digital economy which is remaking both the private and public enterprise alike, forcing every organization to respond to an explosion in users, devices, touch points, and data, forcing significant transformation in channels, connections and relationships.
