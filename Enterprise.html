<h3>SSL, PKI AND DIGITAL CERTIFICATES</h3>
It is now commonplace to utilize public key cryptography to safeguard individuals, networks,
data, and crucial business systems. These public key operations are fundamental to contemporary
operating systems, commercial security products, and custom-built systems, whether PKI digital
certificates are used to encrypt data and ensure privacy, to digitally sign documents and
messages to attest to their integrity and authenticity, or to authenticate users and systems and
control access. Digital certificates are used in e-commerce, online banking, online gambling,
cellphones, and cloud computing to represent the digital identities of users, linked devices, web
services, and corporate applications.

<h3>NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
Network infrastructure refers to the whole network&#39;s hardware and software resources that allow
for network connectivity, communication, operation, and management. It offers the channels and
services for communication between people, operations, software, services, and external
networks/the internet.
A company&#39;s productivity and profitability in the modern digital era depend on more than just
talented, diligent workers and high-functioning technology like computers, printers, and phones.
A strong and secure network infrastructure is necessary for a business to operate properly.
Without a solid infrastructure in place, a business may encounter bad user experiences that harm
staff or consumers, as well as security problems that can reduce employee productivity, drive up
expenses, or even hurt your brand. It&#39;s critical to comprehend network infrastructure and why it&#39;s
important for your company.
